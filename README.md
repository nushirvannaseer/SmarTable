A sample result file and Time Table have been provided for your testing

->Make sure your CSV file does not have an unnecessary space or character at the start of the line which has the day(i.e. Monday, Tuesday etc).

->Your CSV should be semicolon delimited since many courses have commas in between them

->The input format is:
Theory of Automata (BCS-5C)/Computer Networks (BCS-7F)/Tech. & Business Writing (BCS-5C)/Numerical Computing (BCS-5E)/Software Design & Analysis (BCS-5F)/Computer Networks Lab (BCS-5B1, BCS-5B2)

->Make sure the case and spaces between your course names are EXACTLY the same as that mentioned on the date sheet/CSV file. If you find any discrepancy in your file, edit the courses with multiple occurences to have the same spelling and structure.

->If you find any bugs, please do give feedback since this is still a work in progress. More features will be added with time.
